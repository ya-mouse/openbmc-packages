Description
-----------

The chips are hot-swap controllers and I2C current monitors.

As a hardware monitoring driver, only the current monitor functionality is
of interest.

There are no differences between the two chips from the monitoring
point of view. They differ only by the automatic restart feature implemented
in the TPS2481 when a fault occurs.

The driver exports 4 variables through the standard hwmon/sysfs mechanism.

  - in0: Bus Voltage [mV]
  - in1: Shunt Voltage [mV]
  - curr1: Shunt Current [mA]
  - power1: Power [uW]

Upon driver instantiation, a reset is performed to put the chip in its default +state. No programming of the chip is necessary to use it as a simple shunt monitor
(cf. page 36 paragraph 4). The configurable parameters provide different
conversion/averaging/saturation computations, but the default ones provide the
best results.

Current and power registers are not used as the equivalent data is computed by +the driver itself. This does not reduce precision but provide less hassle as +otherwise the calibration register would need to be configured and more complex
computations would have to be done.

Configuration
-------------

The driver needs to know what is the shunt resistance used to measure the current.
This information is mandatory and the driver will fail if not reported.

It can be provided using platform data or using the device tree.

For device tree, insert a property called 'shunt' with an unsigned
integer representing the value in milliohms.

Here is an example of a DTS file snippet declaring the chip for a 30 mOhms shunt:

  ...
  tps2480@40  {
    compatible = "tps2480";
    reg = <0x40>;
    shunt = <30>;
  };
  ...

For platform data, fill the tps2480_platform_data structure defined in
linux/i2c/tps2480.h. It contains a unique element where shunt can be set.
